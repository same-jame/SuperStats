# Super Stats

Super Stats is the community statistics tracker for Planetary Annihilation Titans & Classic.

No code is on the master branch - see rel- branches for code that is currently in use in PA, and dev- branches for potentially broken, but up-to-date code. Organizing the code like this was a terrible mistake.

There are 3 separate projects - client, server, frontend. The client project is the in-game mod code, the server project runs the APIs and the frontend project is for the website.
